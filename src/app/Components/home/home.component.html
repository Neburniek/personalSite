        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I am Rubén Puerta and I love building things on the
             internet. 
            </p>
        <p>
            My coding learning journey started on 2018 when 
            I started building a website to host my bachelor thesis
             online ( Tourist Guide about Moravia, Czech Republic)
              when I still had no idea about coding;
              for that purpose I used wordpress since it was an
               "easy" way of upload something without
                coding skills. </p>
            <p>
                Few months later, I realized I needed
                some CSS skills in order to modify certain 
                sections of the website, so I decided to dive deep
                 and learn how to code. Later on, I started to do some courses
                 on Udemy. On February 2020 I decided to be fully dedicated into
                 this journey and joined the "Universitat Oberta de Catalunya" (UOC)
                 in order to learn how to code profesionally until January 2022 
                 when I finished my Master Degree on Web app and website development.
    
             </p>
    
             <p>During this journey I also created some real life projects which
                 are actually very useful, such as the ¨Templateasy¨( Available for 
                 <a target="_blank" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/templateasy/kobfphnfdonfalajohoembfkfdamcbmp">Chrome</a> 
                 and <a target="_blank" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/addon/templateasy/">Firefox</a> )
                 and I am currently in a very promising project called <a target="_blank" href="http://gastrolinked-test-server.herokuapp.com/">Gastrolinked</a>
             </p>
