            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I am Rubén Puerta and I love building things on the
                 internet. 
                </p>
            <p>
                My coding learning journey started on 2018 when 
                I started building a website to host my bachelor thesis
                 online ( Tourist Guide about Moravia, Czech Republic), at that time I had no idea about coding;
                  for that purpose I used wordpress since it was an
                   "easy" way of upload a website without
                    coding skills. </p>
                <p>
                    Later on, I realized that I needed
                    some CSS skills in order to modify certain 
                    sections of the website, so I decided to dive deep
                     and learn how to code.I started to do some courses
                     on Udemy and on February 2020 I decided to be fully dedicated into
                     this journey and joined the "Universitat Oberta de Catalunya" (UOC)
                     in order to learn how to code profesionally until January 2022 
                     when I succesfully finished my Master Degree on Web app and website development.
        
                 </p>
        
                 <p>During this journey I also created some real life projects, such as the ¨Templateasy¨( Available for 
                     <a target="_blank" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/templateasy/kobfphnfdonfalajohoembfkfdamcbmp">Chrome</a> 
                     and <a target="_blank" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/addon/templateasy/">Firefox</a> )
                     and I am currently on a very promising project called <a target="_blank" href="http://gastrolinked-test-server.herokuapp.com/">Gastrolinked</a> 
                     where restaurants could register and digilatize their ordering system.
